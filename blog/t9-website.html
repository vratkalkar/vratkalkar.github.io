        <div id="content">
          <p>This week allowed me some time to revisit the website and blog that I set up at the beginning of Phase 0. The homepage layout was fine, so I decided to leave it as is. The blog layout on the other hand was a complete mess. I had set up one long scrolling page and added each post to the index as I completed each post. Soon enough, I realized that the width of the posts varied from post to post, and the one pager needed to be revamped.</p>

          <p>The next step was deciding how I could improve the site to improve content readability and add ways for readers to interact with a post. This led me to two ideas, the first being to actually create a dedicated index page somewhat mirroring the homepage index with a background image and black box overlays where the links to my posts would reside. The second was to add commenting functionality to each post, to allow readers to leave comments on the post if they wanted to do so. </p>


          <p>I decided to go with the first two ideas, as I did not want to rework my code right now. Referencing the CSS for the homepage, I added the overlays to house the blog post links and chose a background image. The image displayed sideways for some reason, so I selected a second image and it worked without any issues. I also added a slight CSS animation for the overlays using <a href=" http://daneden.github.io/animate.css">Animate.css</a> to ease the transition after clicking the Blog tab on the homepage.</p>

          <p>Next was adding commenting functionality to each post, which led me to <a href"http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>, which I found had the easiest implementation by a mile. Adding it to each post required simply copying the provided JavaScript code and configuring options on the Disqus account dashboard. Just like that, I had a full featured commenting system on my blog!</p>


          <p>Lastly, I know for a fact that my website and blog will be updated numerous of times over the next few months, so this week I focused on smaller changes that improved the immediate readability and interactivity of the blog.</p>
