          <p>How to frame a question is always interesting, and effectiveness varies for each one. The obvious goal is to recieve an actionable answer that solves your problem, however that is not always received.</p>

          <p>This weeks linked resources went into detail on the general aspects of asking questions on any forum and Stack Overflow, and provided a detailed primer which I will likely reference in the future.</p>

          <p>These past few weeks I have been stuck on one challenge or the other and needed assistance. I had tried every possible solution I could think of, so I decided that posting to the DBC Google+ community would yield the best result. Here is an example of a question I asked:

          (Note: can't embed posts from G+ communites) </p>


          <img src="googleplus1edited.jpg" />

          <p>Looking at this question, I mentioned that challenge and the method I was having difficulty with. What I did not do, as mentioned in the two linked resources, was provide links to what I had I read up to that point and provide my existing code. I now realize that saying "I tried a few conditionals" is a very vague statement which did not add value to the question.</p>

          <p>I received helpful responses, with one particular response asked for me to post my code. I had completely forgotten that doing so would greatly improve the quality of the question, while allowing any responder to see what was already in place.</p>

          <p>On Google Plus I did not have to post a title so that wa snot on issue. On Stack Overflow I will have to add a title, and will have to make it a point to identify the core problem as specifically as possible.I have a tendency to add non-descriptivve titles, more like headers, so it will be a work in progress</p>

          <p>Now I am going to find some questions to ask!</p>
