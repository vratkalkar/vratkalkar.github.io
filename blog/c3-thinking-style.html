          <p> Prior to getting started with Phase 0, a thinking style quiz was assigned. I took the quiz, clearly not having any idea where the result would fall. The result was that I have an Abstract Sequential thinking style. Having absolutely no idea what that meant, I did a quick search for an explanation.</p>

          </p>One <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm">post</a> in particular provided a chart which provided an easy to read break down of the different thinking styles.</p>

          <p>It states that the learner/thinker likes the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Having their point heard</li>
              <li>Analyzing situations before making a decision</li>
              <li>Applying logic in solving or finding solutions</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Then that they learn best when:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>They have access to experts or references</li>
              <li>Placed in a stimulating/exciting environment</li>
              <li>Are able to work alone</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Thinking about how I can use my understanding of my thinking style to my advantage at DBC, I can come up with a few points.</p>

          <p>In general having your point heard is necessary when working with others to reach a consensus on any problem. Analyzing the situation or task at hand before reaching a decision will allow for all needed resources and options to be vetted, ensuring the quality of the submitted work.</p>

          <p>Regarding the application of logic, I believe that takes the most time and is something I have to work on getting a better handle of. Right now I tend to jump right into a problem, starting a system of trial and error, though my thinking style says otherwise.</p>

          <p>I do believe that the first two "learn" best attributes will happen at DBC. The instructors and resources available to me with serve as the "experts" and "references", while the environment can most likely be characterized as intellectually stimulating and exciting. The last one, "working alone", is not likely to happen at DBC as I will be working with a group of students. There might be times when I am reading or coding on my own over the next few months, but I don't think it applies wholly to my experience at DBC.</p>

          <p>Regarding my Phase 0 experience, I can say that it has been an interesting experience. I don't chalk it up to my thinking style, as it has been a combination of factors. I am following a set curriculum, going over previously learned material while learning new material, and finally working on time management. The biggest struggle for me would have to be managing my time and making sure tasks are complete on time. Working to solve challenges, along with the introduction of pair programming and providing feedback is relatively new and so I have been working to set aside timeframes in each day to work on tasks. Ideally I would submit all the work a day in advance, but being realistic I know that isn't always possible. I know that in due time distractions will be minimized and productivity will increase.</p>

          <p>Lastly, I honestly think that the most important way I can expand the way I learn/think is to work to minimize the attention given to distractions and focus on what I deem to be the most important task at the given moment</p>

          </p>
