          <p>The issue of anonymity online has been a topic of great discussion over the past few years. Social networks and online commenting systems have been the focus of this issue as issues have arisen and discussion has ensued.<p>

          <p>Facebook has long championed the use of real names across the site, further reaching with its commenting system. The commenting system has been adopted by numerous sites as a way to cut back on online abuse and general trolling.</p>

          <p>On an interesting note, I do want to point out that Facebook recently released a channel for <a href="http://gizmodo.com/facebook-just-created-a-custom-tor-link-and-thats-aweso-1653274659">Tor</a>, which free software for enabling online anonymity.</p>

          <p>Twitter has recently had a myriad of issues that have involved the safety of its users, some using real names others remaining anonymous. While much has been discussed regarding how they handle communication, what I can do is point to Twitter's <a href="https://support.twitter.com/groups/57-safety-security#">Safety and Security</a> section.</p>

          <p>To add some perspective here, online identity is an issue I can't possibly fully vet in one post, but can add a few points.</p>

          <p>Many have stated that using real names provides authenticity and can hold the user/commenter accountable. That is true in a sense, though not everyone views online communication the same way. The rule of thumb I follow is "If you wouldn't say it offline, don't say it online".</p>

          <p>The pro of online anonymity can involve the discussion of certain topics where the person might not want to disclose their real name, which can be found on niche discussion boards. The con would be the general online commenter that hides behind a pseudonym to target individuals online. The latter is where the call for real names gains support, as it should, while the former has its benefits per case/user.</p>

          <p>This is meant to be a general overview, so I highly recommend you do a general search for "online anonymity" to get a greater understanding and read the many views on this issue.</p>
