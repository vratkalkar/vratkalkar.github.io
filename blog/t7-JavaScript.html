        <div id="content">
          <p>I have been learning programming for almost and like any student of any topic have gotten stuck and searched for a resource for assistance. Like many of you, I have consulted Ruby documentation so many times, that I have lost count. This week introduced, or for some re-introduced, JavaScript which also offers documentation to consult.</p>

          <p>What I want to focus on is the usability of helpfulness of the two languages documentation for beginners.</p>

          <h2>Ruby</h2>

          <p><a href="ruby-doc.org">Ruby-doc.org</a> offers very detailed, thorough documentation on all aspects of the language. I'd quickly recommend navigating the site using the search bar as the docs vary slightly by Ruby version and there are multiple menu's. I did notice a "Getting Started" section on the homepage, which links to additional off-site resources.</p>

          <p>What can be confusing for beginners is that when you reach the site, to get the information you want you can either search or select your Ruby version under the Core API section. Then, scroll down to the Classes section and then select the class you want info on. Again, this is if you haven't searched the term beforehand</p>

          <p>That can be confusing for anyone, especially someone just learning the terminology. To make a long story short, if you need to search the docs search on Google or Bing for the doc link or on site. The site layout can be confusing or just irritating.</p>

          <p>Next, I'll mention the easier to navigate/read MDN JavaScript documentation.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>

          <p>While there are numerous resources available online, the best resource I have come across has been the JavaScript documentation on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network</a> or MDN. Information needed to get started is displayed prominently on the site and navigation is very user friendly.</p>


          <p>On the left hand side tutorials based upon skill level are linked, followed by links to reference materials on Built-in objects, Expressions & operators, Statements & declarations, Functions and literally more. Searching the site is not needed to get to the information you need.</p>

          <p> Next up is reading the information...</p>

          <p>I click "JavaScript Guide" below the Tutorials header and have a manageable table of contents to select from. Each article also has a side navigation so you can move directly to the section you need. This makes all of the information just a few clicks away.</p>

          <p>The code blocks and comments are also much easier to read than Ruby docs, where the examples look like code I would have typed into a text editor.</p>


          <p>A third option, while not necessarily documentation as compared to the MDN guides, <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> offers a very basic reference point or a quick dictionary of sorts.</p>
          <p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

          <p>While not possibly as in depth as a full comparison of documentation can be, this hopefully points out the first noticeable difference after viewing both. The Ruby docs are comprehensive with a relatively poor layout, making it difficult to navigate. There have been times that I have read the docs and been more confused afterward. Lastly, the toggle to view source code is also not truly helpful to anyone working with the language (if it is let me know!).</p>

          <p> On the other hand the MDN JS guide is well structured, easier to read especially the code examples. I read through it numerous times this week and having never really worked with JavaScript outside of a few online tutorials I am able to understand the syntax better after reading.</p>

          <p>To end with a question, who knew the "simpler" Ruby would have more complex documentation than JavaScript as opposed to vice versa!? </p>
