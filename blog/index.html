         <p>Here are a few points regarding version control, git and GitHub that are hopefully helpful and informative:</p>

            <p>1. How would you describe version control?</p>

               <p> Version control is a system that allows you to track and review changes/updates over time to files on your computer. You can then reference or revert back to any files state at any given time. This is very helpful when you realize an update to a file has caused error, or there is a syntax mistake and you need to go back to a previous correct working version.</p>


             <p>2. How does git track changes?</p>

                <p>Running "git status" will check for current changes or untracked files in your working directory. You can add your file(s) to be tracked by typing "git add (filename or .)". All changes will then be tracked when you run the "git status" command again.</p>

                <p>If files have been added, updated, or removed since your last commit(snapshot), they will appear highlighted and marked accordingly in your terminal. You can then determine what you'd like to add or remove from the staging area before typing "git commit -m "add message here".</p>

              <p>3. What are the benefits of using GitHub to store code?</p>

                  <p>GitHub provides a central location to store and share code as opposed to just having it locally on your computer. This proves to be invaluable when working on collaborative projects requiring frequent and/or many contributors. It also provides an easy to navigate user interface for all project repositories and individual files.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, your pushed changes to specific files are also highlighted for better reference and you can access up-to-date project files on any machine as long as you have access to your GitHub account.</p>

                  <p>This is a very quick overview, and if you search for more info on these topics, trust me you'll find hours worth of reading material!</p>

                 <p>Until next time....</p>

        <div id="content">
          <p>After watching the Fireside Chat video my take on DBC has not really changed from my initial take. It is a total immersive experience in software education with a strong "soft skills" component, where I will work with others in the mutual goal of learning. It won't be easy, but then again "bootcamp" doesn't imply easy!
          </p>

          <p>I read quite a bit about DBC leading up to the application process through acceptance and enrollment. This provided me the the primitive information on what to expect from the perspective of previous students. What I know is that this won't be a walk in the park, but rather a set amount of time that will require some reworking of focus, time and expectation managment to achieve the goal I set when settng out to learn web development.
          </p>

          <p>While I won't know exactly how I see my self engaging in this type of learning culture for another few weeks, I know that it will be a stark difference from my prevous learning experiences. The goal is to avoid the "Restaurant Mindset" mentioned in the video, and instead continue Phase 0 and not focus too much on expected outcomes but ensuring I understand the necessary concepts.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, I am a person of habit and routine venturing into unknown territory, so naturally I am a bit apprehensive. What I do know is that to achieve goals sometimes you have to ignore what might have worked in the past and find new, and maybe even better ways to succeed. This might be easier said than done, though the next few weeks will surely help in this process.

        <div id="content">
          <p> When you are looking to apply styles to your webpage you might be thinking, "How do I target only specific elements/tags?". Luckily, this can be done by giving an element a class or an id. This allows you to apply styles to a specific set of tags (classes) or a specific tag (ID).</p>

          <p>It is very important to note the differences between the two as they provide different functionality to your CSS. You can add a class name to multiple HTML elements to apply the same style to the tags from your stylesheet</p>

          <p>Here is an example of HTML elements using a class name on two sets of unordered lists:</p>

           <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/124435e3ae79e465b9d6.js"></script>

           <p>You can then go to your stylesheet and use ".lists" to apply styles to both lists:</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/3f5b66de8da4c0fcf2f0.js"></script>

          <p>Then there are ID's which are unique and can only be applied to one HTML element on a webpage. This is benficial when there is one specific section you want to set aside/style such as "#content" for the main section of your website.</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/37590649e16409270f42.js"></script>

          <p>Here are some quick points to remember when deciding whether to use a class or ID:</p>



          <p>Class:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use the tag to style multiple elements</li>
            <li>The style isn't specific to one section of the webpage</li>
          </ul>

          <p>ID:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tag can only be used on one element in a webpage</li>
            <li>That specific style is only used once on the webpage. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is just a brief intro, and will most likely be updated in the future. Lastly, I hope this was somewhat helpful to you the reader.</p>
