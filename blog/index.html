         <p>Here are a few points regarding version control, git and GitHub that are hopefully helpful and informative:</p>

            <p>1. How would you describe version control?</p>

               <p> Version control is a system that allows you to track and review changes/updates over time to files on your computer. You can then reference or revert back to any files state at any given time. This is very helpful when you realize an update to a file has caused error, or there is a syntax mistake and you need to go back to a previous correct working version.</p>


             <p>2. How does git track changes?</p>

                <p>Running "git status" will check for current changes or untracked files in your working directory. You can add your file(s) to be tracked by typing "git add (filename or .)". All changes will then be tracked when you run the "git status" command again.</p>

                <p>If files have been added, updated, or removed since your last commit(snapshot), they will appear highlighted and marked accordingly in your terminal. You can then determine what you'd like to add or remove from the staging area before typing "git commit -m "add message here".</p>

              <p>3. What are the benefits of using GitHub to store code?</p>

                  <p>GitHub provides a central location to store and share code as opposed to just having it locally on your computer. This proves to be invaluable when working on collaborative projects requiring frequent and/or many contributors. It also provides an easy to navigate user interface for all project repositories and individual files.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, your pushed changes to specific files are also highlighted for better reference and you can access up-to-date project files on any machine as long as you have access to your GitHub account.</p>

                  <p>This is a very quick overview, and if you search for more info on these topics, trust me you'll find hours worth of reading material!</p>

                 <p>Until next time....</p>

          <p>After watching the Fireside Chat video my take on DBC has not really changed from my initial take.</p><p>It is a total immersive experience in software education with a strong "soft skills" component, where I will work with others in the mutual goal of learning. It won't be easy, but then again "bootcamp" doesn't imply easy!</p>

          <p>I read quite a bit about DBC leading up to the application process through acceptance and enrollment. This provided me the the primitive information on what to expect from the perspective of previous students. What I know is that this won't be a walk in the park, but rather a set amount of time that will require some reworking of focus, time and expectation managment to achieve the goal I set when settng out to learn web development.</p>

          <p>While I won't know exactly how I see my self engaging in this type of learning culture for another few weeks, I know that it will be a stark difference from my prevous learning experiences. The goal is to avoid the "Restaurant Mindset" mentioned in the video, and instead continue Phase 0 and not focus too much on expected outcomes but ensuring I understand the necessary concepts. </p>

          <p>Lastly, I am a person of habit and routine venturing into unknown territory, so naturally I am a bit apprehensive. What I do know is that to achieve goals sometimes you have to ignore what might have worked in the past and find new, and maybe even better ways to succeed. This might be easier said than done, though the next few weeks will surely help in this process.</p>

              Classes and ID's Explained
          </p>

        <div id="content">
          <p> When you are looking to apply styles to your webpage you might be thinking, "How do I target only specific elements/tags?". Luckily, this can be done by giving an element a class or an id. This allows you to apply styles to a specific set of tags (classes) or a specific tag (ID).</p>

          <p>It is very important to note the differences between the two as they provide different functionality to your CSS. You can add a class name to multiple HTML elements to apply the same style to the tags from your stylesheet</p>

          <p>Here is an example of HTML elements using a class name on two sets of unordered lists:</p>

           <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/124435e3ae79e465b9d6.js"></script>

           <p>You can then go to your stylesheet and use ".lists" to apply styles to both lists:</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/3f5b66de8da4c0fcf2f0.js"></script>

          <p>Then there are ID's which are unique and can only be applied to one HTML element on a webpage. This is benficial when there is one specific section you want to set aside/style such as "#content" for the main section of your website.</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/37590649e16409270f42.js"></script>

          <p>Here are some quick points to remember when deciding whether to use a class or ID:</p>



          <p>Class:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use the tag to style multiple elements</li>
            <li>The style isn't specific to one section of the webpage</li>
          </ul>

          <p>ID:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tag can only be used on one element in a webpage</li>
            <li>That specific style is only used once on the webpage. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is just a brief intro, and will most likely be updated in the future. Lastly, I hope this was somewhat helpful to you the reader.</p>

              Arrays and Hashes
          </p>
          <p>
              October 26th, 2014
          </p>
        </div>


        <div id="content">
          <p>
             You're looking to store a collection of values(integers, strings), essentially a list in order, that you can access in your program. This is where arrays can be useful. You can create an array like this:</p>

             <p>array_name = [1,2,3,4]</p>

             <p>Now you can access the values in the array a few ways. You can access individual values like this:</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/affb26a3d28becb9eb79.js"></script>

             <p>Let's say you want to display the values in the array using one method. In this case you can iterate over the array using the ".each" method :</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/64ab876b3c3a04f874af.js"></script>

             <p>Lastly, here are just a few methods you can use when working with arrays:</p>

             <ul>
               <li>.length : shows the number of values in the array</li>
               <li>.sort : sorts the array alphabetically </li>
               <li>.first : displays the first value in the array </li>
               <li>.last: displays the last value in the array </li>
               <li>.methods: This lists all of the methods you can call on an object </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are many more methods, though you can search the Ruby docs to get the info.</p>

          </p>

          <p>While arrays are set with an numerical index, what's great about hashes is that they allow you to store key value pairs.

           <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/2329251117aea96eddba.js"></script>

          <p> Now if you want to retrieve the a value you can do so like this:</p>

           <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/27f279bf4fb9296a8fb5.js"></script>

           <p>The use of keys also provides for an easy to remember way to access values, namely strings, as opposed to the numerical index of a value when using arrays</p>

           <p>There is a lot more information available on Hashes, which can be found <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Hash.html">here!</a></p>

              Thinking Style
          </p>
          <p>
              October 26th, 2014
          </p>
        </div>


        <div id="content">
          <p> Prior to getting started with Phase 0, a thinking style quiz was assigned. I took the quiz, clearly not having any idea where the result would fall. The result was that I have an Abstract Sequential thinking style. Having absolutely no idea what that meant, I did a quick search for an explanation.</p>

          <p>One <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm">post</a> in particular provided a chart which provided an easy to read break down of the different thinking styles.</p>

          <p>It states that the learner/thinker likes the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Having their point heard</li>
              <li>Analyzing situations before making a decision</li>
              <li>Applying logic in solving or finding solutions</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Then that they learn best when:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>They have access to experts or references</li>
              <li>Placed in a stimulating/exciting environment</li>
              <li>Are able to work alone</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Thinking about how I can use my understanding of my thinking style to my advantage at DBC, I can come up with a few points.</p>

          <p>In general having your point heard is necessary when working with others to reach a consensus on any problem. Analyzing the situation or task at hand before reaching a decision will allow for all needed resources and options to be vetted, ensuring the quality of the submitted work.</p>

          <p>Regarding the application of logic, I believe that takes the most time and is something I have to work on getting a better handle of. Right now I tend to jump right into a problem, starting a system of trial and error, though my thinking style says otherwise.</p>

          <p>I do believe that the first two "learn" best attributes will happen at DBC. The instructors and resources available to me with serve as the "experts" and "references", while the environment can most likely be characterized as intellectually stimulating and exciting.</p>

          <p> The last one, "working alone", is not likely to happen at DBC as I will be working with a group of students. There might be times when I am reading or coding on my own over the next few months, but I don't think it applies wholly to my experience at DBC.</p>

          <p>Regarding my Phase 0 experience, I can say that it has been an interesting experience. I don't chalk it up to my thinking style, as it has been a combination of factors. I am following a set curriculum, going over previously learned material while learning new material, and finally working on time management. The biggest struggle for me would have to be managing my time and making sure tasks are complete on time. Working to solve challenges, along with the introduction of pair programming and providing feedback is relatively new and so I have been working to set aside timeframes in each day to work on tasks. Ideally I would submit all the work a day in advance, but being realistic I know that isn't always possible. I know that in due time distractions will be minimized and productivity will increase.</p>

          <p>Lastly, I honestly think that the most important way I can expand the way I learn/think is to work to minimize the attention given to distractions and focus on what I deem to be the most important task at the given moment</p>

              Feedback
          </p>

        </div>


        <div id="content">


          <p>Pair programming has been an interesting experience over the past few weeks of Phase 0. To have a video/phone call with a person you have most likely never seen or spoken to can be odd at first, though that eventually becomes a non-issue. After all, the end goal is to solve the challenge.</p>

          <p>I tend to work slowly on challenges, often taking time to research the concept followed by the steps necessary to solve the challenge. Right now that is a bit time consuming, and when pairing time is usually limited so I start to feel the need to rush and contribute as quickly as possible to the solution.</p>

          <p>This is not to say that I am unprepared when working on the challenges, but at the speed at which I process the concepts I do feel that I am sometimes lagging behind. This might not appear to be the case to those working with me, but it has been a point of concern personally.</p>

          <p>When working with a pair on certain challenges solutions have been found much faster, when I know for sure that working solo would have yielded endless research. It is benficial having someone to work with where you can discuss why specific code was used and what it accomplishes.</p>

          <p>Next in the process is feedback and the role in which it plays in the learning process.</p>

          <p>Reading feedback is both rewarding and frustrating. Rewarding in the sense that you read the pros and cons of working with you described by your peers, which can then be incorporated into your workflow. Frustrating in the sense that receiving any form of criticism is not always welcome.</p>

          <p>A few pieces of feedback I have recieved have mentioned communicating my ideas better and decisiveness in choosing driver/navigator roles, which are two things I can definitely work on.</p>

          <p>Another interesting aspect is writing feedback. You want to remain anonymous while meeting the Actionable, Specific, Kind criteria. I have struggled to write actionable and specific feedback, as I unintentionally tend to try and avoid any form of pair criticism. It is a work in progress, which should get better over time.</p>

          <p>Lastly, pair programming in Phase 0 has had it's pros and cons. Everyone is working to solve challenges, though sometimes pairing takes more time and managing roles becomes difficult. In certain cases it is beneficial as working solo leads to a loop of research/code/delete/research/code/rspec which eventually requires help from others, which working with a pair can solve.</p>

              Object Oriented Programming Concepts
          </p>
          <p>
              November 15th, 2014
          </p>
        </div>


        <div id="content">
          <p>Every program includes a multitude of variables, each using a different syntax denoting its accessibiity, or <em>scope</em>.</p>

          <p>These differences are important and is where understanding the concept of variable scope becomes very important.</p>

          <p>In this weeks challenges a section covered variable scope and mentioned the following variable types:
            <ul>
              <li>Constant Variables</li>
              <li>Global Variables</li>
              <li>Instance Variables</li>
              <li>Class Variables</li>
              <li>Local Variables</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Constant Variables</h2>
          <p>To start at the top of the list, lets take a look at Constant variables. A Ruby constant is written in all caps (ex. MY_NAME) and  stores a value throughout a program. If you try to reassign the variable a warning will be thrown though unlike other programming languages, the value with be changed, which is not always ideal.</p>

          <h2>Global Variables</h2>
          <p>Global variables, which start with "$", are also accessible throughout a Ruby program. The issue with the accessibility is that the value can be modified from anywhere in that same program.</p>

          <h2>Instance Variables</h2>
          <p> Instance variables, which you have likely created numerous times over the past few weeks, begin with "@" and are accessible by instances of the class it is defined in. So lets say you have a variable @sum, which is modified on the instance of the class Math. The value of @sum is only specific to the instance and is not modified within the class itself.</p>

          <h2>Class Variables</h2>
          <p> Class variables, starting with "@@" are shared across every instance of the class that contains it. Now, if one instance modifies the value of the variable, the new value will be modified for subsequent instances as well.</p>

          <h2>Local Variables</h2>
          <p>Local variables, simply a downcased variable name without any prefixed symbols, are set within methods or loops and cannot be accessed elsewhere. If you try to access the variable outside of where it is declared an error will be thrown.

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/8d13c65f7c142c569535.js"></script>

        </p>

          <p>Lastly, of all of these variables you will almost always use instance, class, and local variables and the scope of constant and global variables will likely increase returned errors/bugs when they are modified. Also, I encourage you to do a simple search of "ruby variable scope" to find the many available online resources.</p>

              Reading the Docs
          </p>
          <p>
              November 22nd, 2014
          </p>
        </div>


        <div id="content">
          <p>I have been learning programming for almost and like any student of any topic have gotten stuck and searched for a resource for assistance. Like many of you, I have consulted Ruby documentation so many times, that I have lost count. This week introduced, or for some re-introduced, JavaScript which also offers documentation to consult.</p>

          <p>What I want to focus on is the usability of helpfulness of the two languages documentation for beginners.</p>

          <h2>Ruby</h2>

          <p><a href="ruby-doc.org">Ruby-doc.org</a> offers very detailed, thorough documentation on all aspects of the language. I'd quickly recommend navigating the site using the search bar as the docs vary slightly by Ruby version and there are multiple menu's. I did notice a "Getting Started" section on the homepage, which links to additional off-site resources.</p>

          <p>What can be confusing for beginners is that when you reach the site, to get the information you want you can either search or select your Ruby version under the Core API section. Then, scroll down to the Classes section and then select the class you want info on. Again, this is if you haven't searched the term beforehand</p>

          <p>That can be confusing for anyone, especially someone just learning the terminology. To make a long story short, if you need to search the docs search on Google or Bing for the doc link or on site. The site layout can be confusing or just irritating.</p>

          <p>Next, I'll mention the easier to navigate/read MDN JavaScript documentation.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>

          <p>While there are numerous resources available online, the best resource I have come across has been the JavaScript documentation on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript">Mozilla Developer Network</a> or MDN. Information needed to get started is displayed prominently on the site and navigation is very user friendly.</p>


          <p>On the left hand side tutorials based upon skill level are linked, followed by links to reference materials on Built-in objects, Expressions & operators, Statements & declarations, Functions and literally more. Searching the site is not needed to get to the information you need.</p>

          <p> Next up is reading the information...</p>

          <p>I click "JavaScript Guide" below the Tutorials header and have a manageable table of contents to select from. Each article also has a side navigation so you can move directly to the section you need. This makes all of the information just a few clicks away.</p>

          <p>The code blocks and comments are also much easier to read than Ruby docs, where the examples look like code I would have typed into a text editor.</p>


          <p>A third option, while not necessarily documentation as compared to the MDN guides, <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> offers a very basic reference point or a quick dictionary of sorts.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

          <p>While not possibly as in depth as a full comparison of documentation can be, this hopefully points out the first noticeable difference after viewing both. The Ruby docs are comprehensive with a relatively poor layout, making it difficult to navigate. There have been times that I have read the docs and been more confused afterward. Lastly, the toggle to view source code is also not truly helpful to anyone working with the language (if it is let me know!).</p>

          <p> On the other hand the MDN JS guide is well structured, easier to read especially the code examples. I read through it numerous times this week and having never really worked with JavaScript outside of a few online tutorials I am able to understand the syntax better after reading.</p>

          <p>To end with a question, who knew the "simpler" Ruby would have more complex documentation than JavaScript as opposed to vice versa!? </p>

              Reflecting on Values
          </p>
          <p>
              November 23rd, 2014
          </p>

        <div id="content">

          <p> I did some quick reading on self-affirmation and the explanation that was easiest to understand came from the great Wikipedia. It stated, "Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self."</p>

          <p>There are also many more reference materials that go into further depth on this topic, but that's for a later time.<p>

          <p>This week's blogging task provided a multitude of values to associate with times of happiness and satisfaction in life. I thought for some time, and the first two life events were easy for me, high school and college graduation. The other two events I thought of were Demo Day after the startup I was working with had just completed a three month accelerator program and applying to and being accepted into DBC.<p>

          <p>Armed wih four events to reflect on I read through the list and the following values resonated with me:
            <ul>
               <li>Accomplishment</li>
               <li>Achievement</li>
               <li>Ambition</li>
               <li>Enthusiasm</li>
               <li>Introspection</li>
               <li>Personal Development</li>
               <li>Challenge</li>
               <li>Having a family</li>
               <li>Wisdom</li>
               <li>Music</li>
               <li>Competence</li>
               <li>Self-knowledge</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Important Values</h2>

          <p>To choose one value from that list to highlight its importance is very difficult as each one equally as important as the other overall.</p>

          <p>Selecting a specific value, I'd say <strong>ambition</strong> is and has been the driving force behind each of the life events I mentioned earlier. The absence of ambitition would have let the struggles in high school(as mentioned here) get in the way of me going to college, where I thrived. The lack of ambition would have led to never joining a startup in New York City, where I gained priceless knowledge. Lastly, without ambition I would not have left my job to learn web development which has since led me to Dev Bootcamp.</p>

          <p>Looking back now on the list above, I should probably move ambition to the top of the list.</p>

          <h2>Rating Values</h2>

          <p>I try my best to live up to the values I listed, though at times it is not always possible. Every situation or even day brings osmething different to the table. Now if I have to rate how I adhere to these values, it would go something like this:

          <ul>
               <li>Accomplishment - 5 </li>
               <li>Achievement - 4</li>
               <li>Ambition - 5</li>
               <li>Enthusiasm - 5</li>
               <li>Introspection - 3 </li>
               <li>Personal Development - 5</li>
               <li>Challenge - 3 </li>
               <li>Having a family - 5 </li>
               <li>Wisdom - 4</li>
               <li>Music - 4 </li>
               <li>Competence - 5 </li>
               <li>Self-knowledge - 4 </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Advice</h2>

            <p>I have been a hobbyist musician for about 12 years now, playing everything from guitar(acoustic/electric), bass guitar and drums.</p>

            <p>Recently, my uncle asked me which guitar would be a good buy to replace his old Fender acoustic. I immediately said, while the price tags are significant, Martin acoustic guitars are amazing. I then proceeded to talk about maplewood, rosewood and alder as if I owned a lumber yard!</p>

            <p>I was then asked about strings, which led to another conversation about string gauges/types, and recommended brands.</p>

            <p>It was definitely nice to be asked about something besides phones for a change.<p>

          <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>

          <p>Now back to a more serious note, thinking about my values I feel confident in my ability to identify/work through stereotype threat should it arise. The values I have mentioned haven't changed in quite some time and with each life experience they are almost always strengthened</p>

          <p>Having utilized self-motivation in past experiences, should I feel down at anytime at DBC that ability to reflect on how I handle those experiences will be helpful. It is sometimes the case where struggle initially lowers my self-confidence only for it to build back up stronger through rationalizing the experience and focusing on the eventual positives.</p>

          <p>On a lighter note, I could also just travel with my guitar and strum away since that is the ultimate mood booster!</p>
