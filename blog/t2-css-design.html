          <p> When you are looking to apply styles to your webpage you might be thinking, "How do I target only specific elements/tags?". Luckily, this can be done by giving an element a class or an id. This allows you to apply styles to a specific set of tags (classes) or a specific tag (ID).</p>

          <p>It is very important to note the differences between the two as they provide different functionality to your CSS. You can add a class name to multiple HTML elements to apply the same style to the tags from your stylesheet</p>

          <p>Here is an example of HTML elements using a class name on two sets of unordered lists:</p>

           <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/124435e3ae79e465b9d6.js"></script>

           <p>You can then go to your stylesheet and use ".lists" to apply styles to both lists:</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/3f5b66de8da4c0fcf2f0.js"></script>

          <p>Then there are ID's which are unique and can only be applied to one HTML element on a webpage. This is benficial when there is one specific section you want to set aside/style such as "#content" for the main section of your website.</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/37590649e16409270f42.js"></script>

          <p>Here are some quick points to remember when deciding whether to use a class or ID:</p>



          <p>Class:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use the tag to style multiple elements</li>
            <li>The style isn't specific to one section of the webpage</li>
          </ul>

          <p>ID:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The tag can only be used on one element in a webpage</li>
            <li>That specific style is only used once on the webpage. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This is just a brief intro, and will most likely be updated in the future. Lastly, I hope this was somewhat helpful to you the reader.</p>
