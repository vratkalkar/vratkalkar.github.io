              Enumerable Methods in Ruby
          </p>

        <div id="content">
          <p>There are additional methods in Ruby that can be called on a object. These are referred to as Enumerables. There are countless enumerable methods that can be called on an object, with the full list viewable <a href ="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Enumerable.html">here.</a></p>

          <p>The method I am going to focus on today is the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">#map</a> method. The #map method can be called on an object and returns a new array with the results of running the passed code block on every element</p>

          <p>This might sound similar to the #each method, however there is one significant difference. The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Array.html#method-i-each">#each</a> method iterates through each element of an array, however #map returns a new modified array, while #each returns the original array.</p>

          <p>This is an example of the #map method:</p>

             <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/df0c0adfcdf335d06071.js"></script>

          <p>To use the #each method as a comparison, if you called .each on the object above, the original array not the modified one would be returned<p>

          <p>Here are some quick facts about the #map method for reference:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The returned array is always the same size as the original enumerable</li>
                <li>The returned array elements are the result of calling the passed code block on each element</li>
                <li>You can also pass certain symbols as arguments to a  block ( ex. week.map(&:reverse)) which returns the array string elements reversed.</li>
              </ul>

          <p> I highly recommend reading the docs I mentioned earlier as well as books, such as <a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/"> The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, for much more detailed information on this topic.</p>
