          <p>After watching the Fireside Chat video my take on DBC has not really changed from my initial take. It is a total immersive experience in software education with a strong "soft skills" component, where I will work with others in the mutual goal of learning. It won't be easy, but then again "bootcamp" doesn't imply easy!
          </p>

          <p>I read quite a bit about DBC leading up to the application process through acceptance and enrollment. This provided me the the primitive information on what to expect from the perspective of previous students. What I know is that this won't be a walk in the park, but rather a set amount of time that will require some reworking of focus, time and expectation managment to achieve the goal I set when settng out to learn web development.
          </p>

          <p>While I won't know exactly how I see my self engaging in this type of learning culture for another few weeks, I know that it will be a stark difference from my prevous learning experiences. The goal is to avoid the "Restaurant Mindset" mentioned in the video, and instead continue Phase 0 and not focus too much on expected outcomes but ensuring I understand the necessary concepts.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, I am a person of habit and routine venturing into unknown territory, so naturally I am a bit apprehensive. What I do know is that to achieve goals sometimes you have to ignore what might have worked in the past and find new, and maybe even better ways to succeed. This might be easier said than done, though the next few weeks will surely help in this process.
