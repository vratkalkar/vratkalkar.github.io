               Dealing with Internal Conflict

          <p>Thinking back on times of conflict in my life I came to the realization that internal conflict (with myself) has occured far more than with others.</p>

         <p>In previous posts I have mentioned the role of anxiety in my life, and it has been the driving forces behind the conflict I deal with on a daily basis. It has created  created a myriad of unneccesary conflicts.</p>

         <p>Some people can easily dismiss a worry or thought, but that ability has taken me years to develop. Learning to step back from a situation and rationalize has helped me overcome worries/thoughts that at one time I thought were insurmountable.</p>

         <p>Initially when faced with the tricks my mind was playing on me, I thought "All right, maybe I will avoid that situation and everything will improve". What I didn't know at the time was that avoidance would work in the short term though in the long term would prove to be detrimental. Now, while not always the easiest thing to do , I make it a point to enter the situation. When struggles arise, through assistance I have received and learned mechanisms, I do my best to rationalize my thought process, giving importance to what is relevant to the task at hand.<p>

         <p> Looking back early on, I didn't now the scope of my worries/fears so I gave too much credence to them. One time, having had school based anxiety I would lobby to stay home, attempting to use emotional pleas to hopefully influence the outcome. I did not want to deal with the nervousness I dealt with every day, and as I mentioned earlier, wanted to avoid it.</p>

         <p>Thankfully, while my concerns were heard the action I sought was not taken. Instead I dealt with the issues I faced every day and learned not just mechanisms to get by, but later on how to turn that into success.</p>

         <p>Lastly, every day is a work in progress, a blank slate if you will. Conflict has arisen in some form every day, and I know that external conflict will without a doubt occur. Using strategies that I have implemented in my dealings with my own conflicts, I am confident that when issues with others occur, I will be able to modify my existing strategies to resolve immediate external conflicts.</p>
