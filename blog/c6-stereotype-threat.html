          <h2>Early On</h2>

          <p>Researching stereotype threat, I realized that I have experienced it in one form or another since high school. In my high school years I dealt with serious anxiety issues, which greatly affected my learning ability. Unable at times to sit classrooms, I wasn't able to truly learn the material being covered. The consequence was my grades suffering and not reflecting my intellectual capacity.</p>

          <p>In terms of racial stereotypes, when you think of Indians/Indian-Americans you usually think of very smart people, and in high school that involves AP courses and extracurricular activities. I definitely did not meet that, since due to my grades I had to take lower level courses. This was very frustrating, to say the least, as I knew that I was much smarter than my grades showed. I would joke, "I'm one of the few Indians not in AP courses!", which at the time was an attempt at humor though it really just continually reaffirmed that my intelligence level was low. This was not the case, and through hard work was able to rationalize anxieties, graduate high school and succeed in college</p>

          <p>On a more humorous note, if you want to learn how to deal with anxiety just go to college in New York City!</p>

          <h2>Now</h2>

          <p>Now I now fit another stereotype as an Indian interested in tech/programming. There were times in the past when I would be asked at work if I was a developer, even though at the time I was not! At least now when I am asked I can nod and smile, or roll my eyes!</p>

          <p>In terms of tech/programming I know that there are people with more knowledge and there will be a feeling of inadequacy when a conept is grasped immediately by someone else while I lag behind. That will happen but I know it doesn't mean I am not as intelligent, it just means that I have to work some more to fully understand the concept. As a quote I recently read stated, "Remember, every expert was once a beginner".</p>

          <p>Lastly, while there will be struggles as I continue to learn a challenging subject, having previously hurdled significant obstacles I know that with the right mindset, focus and determination I will succeed.</p>
