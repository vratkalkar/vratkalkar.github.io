               Reflecting on Values
          </p>
          <p>

        <div id="content">

          <p> I did some quick reading on self-affirmation and the explanation that was easiest to understand came from the great Wikipedia. It stated, "Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self."</p>

          <p>There are also many more reference materials that go into further depth on this topic, but that's for a later time.<p>

          <p>This week's blogging task provided a multitude of values to associate with times of happiness and satisfaction in life. I thought for some time, and the first two life events were easy for me, high school and college graduation. The other two events I thought of were Demo Day after the startup I was working with had just completed a three month accelerator program and applying to and being accepted into DBC.<p>

          <p>Armed wih four events to reflect on I read through the list and the following values resonated with me:
            <ul>
               <li>Accomplishment</li>
               <li>Achievement</li>
               <li>Ambition</li>
               <li>Enthusiasm</li>
               <li>Introspection</li>
               <li>Personal Development</li>
               <li>Challenge</li>
               <li>Having a family</li>
               <li>Wisdom</li>
               <li>Music</li>
               <li>Competence</li>
               <li>Self-knowledge</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Important Values</h2>

          <p>To choose one value from that list to highlight its importance is very difficult as each one equally as important as the other overall.</p>

          <p>Selecting a specific value, I'd say <strong>ambition</strong> is and has been the driving force behind each of the life events I mentioned earlier. The absence of ambitition would have let the struggles in high school(as mentioned here) get in the way of me going to college, where I thrived. The lack of ambition would have led to never joining a startup in New York City, where I gained priceless knowledge. Lastly, without ambition I would not have left my job to learn web development which has since led me to Dev Bootcamp.</p>

          <p>Looking back now on the list above, I should probably move ambition to the top of the list.</p>

          <h2>Rating Values</h2>

          <p>I try my best to live up to the values I listed, though at times it is not always possible. Every situation or even day brings osmething different to the table. Now if I have to rate how I adhere to these values, it would go something like this:

          <ul>
               <li>Accomplishment - 5 </li>
               <li>Achievement - 4</li>
               <li>Ambition - 5</li>
               <li>Enthusiasm - 5</li>
               <li>Introspection - 3 </li>
               <li>Personal Development - 5</li>
               <li>Challenge - 3 </li>
               <li>Having a family - 5 </li>
               <li>Wisdom - 4</li>
               <li>Music - 4 </li>
               <li>Competence - 5 </li>
               <li>Self-knowledge - 4 </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Advice</h2>

            <p>I have been a hobbyist musician for about 12 years now, playing everything from guitar(acoustic/electric), bass guitar and drums.</p>

            <p>Recently, my uncle asked me which guitar would be a good buy to replace his old Fender acoustic. I immediately said, while the price tags are significant, Martin acoustic guitars are amazing. I then proceeded to talk about maplewood, rosewood and alder as if I owned a lumber yard!</p>

            <p>I was then asked about strings, which led to another conversation about string gauges/types, and recommended brands.</p>

            <p>It was definitely nice to be asked about something besides phones for a change.<p>

          <h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>

          <p>Now back to a more serious note, thinking about my values I feel confident in my ability to identify/work through stereotype threat should it arise. The values I have mentioned haven't changed in quite some time and with each life experience they are almost always strengthened</p>

          <p>Having utilized self-motivation in past experiences, should I feel down at anytime at DBC that ability to reflect on how I handle those experiences will be helpful. It is sometimes the case where struggle initially lowers my self-confidence only for it to build back up stronger through rationalizing the experience and focusing on the eventual positives.</p>

          <p>On a lighter note, I could also just travel with my guitar and strum away since that is the ultimate mood booster!</p>
