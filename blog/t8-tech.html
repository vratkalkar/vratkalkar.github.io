          <p>When you first hear about dynmaic and static typing, your first thought might be, "Oh, that has to be how you type on the keyboard. Right?" Well, that's quite literal and is not the case.</p>

        <h2>Type Systems</h2>
          <p>In programming speak, "typing" refers to data types. Also, there is what is called a type system. A type system is a set of rules that assign a type to variables, functions or expressions. The goal of a type system is to eradicate bugs in your program by defining interfaces between the parts of the program. Then the parts are checked to ensure that the connection is consistent.</p>

          <p>The checking of the parts can happen at compile time(static), or run-time(dynamic) meaning when the program is running/executed</p>

         <h2>Static Typed</h2>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, when the type check is done when compiling, the language is said to be static. Type information is bound to a variable and is checked at compile time. Here are a few static typed languages for your reference:
            <ul>
              <li>Java</li>
              <li>C</li>
              <li>Scala</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

         <h2>Dynamic Typed</h2>
         <p>A programming language is said to use dynamic typing, if the type check is done at run-time. In this case, the type of a variable is bound to its value and type checking occurs at run time</p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/vratkalkar/368047f1c6b6e7d9da02.js"></script>
         <p>Here a few of todays widely used languages that use dynamic typing:
          <ul>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>In closing, this is a topic that requires additional reading as understanding the differences is important. One link from Smashing Magazine can be found <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/18/introduction-to-programming-type-systems/">here.</a>
