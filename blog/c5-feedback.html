          <p>Pair programming has been an interesting experience over the past few weeks of Phase 0. To have a video/phone call with a person you have most likely never seen or spoken to can be odd at first, though that eventually becomes a non-issue. After all, the end goal is to solve the challenge.</p>

          <p>I tend to work slowly on challenges, often taking time to research the concept followed by the steps necessary to solve the challenge. Right now that is a bit time consuming, and when pairing time is usually limited so I start to feel the need to rush and contribute as quickly as possible to the solution.</p>

          <p>This is not to say that I am unprepared when working on the challenges, but at the speed at which I process the concepts I do feel that I am sometimes lagging behind. This might not appear to be the case to those working with me, but it has been a point of concern personally.</p>

          <p>When working with a pair on certain challenges solutions have been found much faster, when I know for sure that working solo would have yielded endless research. It is benficial having someone to work with where you can discuss why specific code was used and what it accomplishes.</p>

          <p>Next in the process is feedback and the role in which it plays in the learning process.</p>

          <p>Reading feedback is both rewarding and frustrating. Rewarding in the sense that you read the pros and cons of working with you described by your peers, which can then be incorporated into your workflow. Frustrating in the sense that receiving any form of criticism is not always welcome.</p>

          <p>A few pieces of feedback I have recieved have mentioned communicating my ideas better and decisiveness in choosing driver/navigator roles, which are two things I can definitely work on.</p>

          <p>Another interesting aspect is writing feedback. You want to remain anonymous while meeting the Actionable, Specific, Kind criteria. I have struggled to write actionable and specific feedback, as I unintentionally tend to try and avoid any form of pair criticism. It is a work in progress, which should get better over time.</p>

          <p>Lastly, pair programming in Phase 0 has had it's pros and cons. Everyone is working to solve challenges, though sometimes pairing takes more time and managing roles becomes difficult. In certain cases it is beneficial as working solo leads to a loop of research/code/delete/research/code/rspec which eventually requires help from others, which working with a pair can solve.</p>
