        <p>Here are a few points regarding version control, git and GitHub that are hopefully helpful and informative:</p>

            <p>1. How would you describe version control?</p>

               <p> Version control is a system that allows you to track and review changes/updates over time to files on your computer. You can then reference or revert back to any files state at any given time. This is very helpful when you realize an update to a file has caused error, or there is a syntax mistake and you need to go back to a previous correct working version.</p>


             <p>2. How does git track changes?</p>

                <p>Running "git status" will check for current changes or untracked files in your working directory. You can add your file(s) to be tracked by typing "git add (filename or .)". All changes will then be tracked when you run the "git status" command again.</p>

                <p>If files have been added, updated, or removed since your last commit(snapshot), they will appear highlighted and marked accordingly in your terminal. You can then determine what you'd like to add or remove from the staging area before typing "git commit -m "add message here".</p>

              <p>3. What are the benefits of using GitHub to store code?</p>

                  <p>GitHub provides a central location to store and share code as opposed to just having it locally on your computer. This proves to be invaluable when working on collaborative projects requiring frequent and/or many contributors. It also provides an easy to navigate user interface for all project repositories and individual files.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, your pushed changes to specific files are also highlighted for better reference and you can access up-to-date project files on any machine as long as you have access to your GitHub account.</p>

                  <p>This is a very quick overview, and if you search for more info on these topics, trust me you'll find hours worth of reading material!</p>

                 <p>Until next time....</p>
